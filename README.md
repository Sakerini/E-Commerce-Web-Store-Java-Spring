# Model View Controller

The Spring Web MVC framework provides model-view-controller architecture and ready components that can be used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web applications

  - The Model encapsulates the application data and in general they will consist of POJO
  - The View is responsible for rendering the model data and in general it generates HTML output that the client's browser can interpret
  - The Controller is responsible for proccessing user requests and building appropriate model and passes it to the view for rendering.
